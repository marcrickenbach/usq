|   FUNCTION:   Application Layer: oversees threads below. 
|               Controls two hw timers that are declared in instance.h within timer struct
|               When pots change, values internal to thread get updated by way of public pot change listener callback.
|               TODO: When button press (in button thread) occurs, set new step active values for appropriate channel and alert UI. 
|               When Channel x/y interrupt occurs, message gets sent to sequencer queue to handle respective channel events. 
|                   -- event Timer X/Y up: we set dac value via public api, set channel gate (just toggles a gpio), send message to UI thread for LEDs.
|                   -- Sequencer sends MIDI information to UART Thread. Note: this isn't working yet, I think it has something to do with the nucleo board device tree, but am not certain.
|               On receiving a pot change event from the Pot module, we post new value to the instance struct keeping track of all our sequencer data. 
|               I've also sketched up a function that would check to see if any of the pots are associated with a currently active step, in which case we would take care of new dac and gate messages. 
|
|   NOTES:
|               note: seq struct to instance that holds all of both channels information. 
|               note: included pot.h in sequencer evt.h 
|               TODO: Handle any mode changes, e.g. can set two sequencers anywhere from 16:0 / 0:16 steps. (save this for later)
|               TODO: Would any quantizing happen somewhere in this thread before going to DAC? (save this for later)
|               ?   : Do we handle processing of MIDI data in sequencer thread or in the UART thread?

|	///////////////////////////////////////
| - // DAC Thread
|	///////////////////////////////////////	
|	
|	    FUNCTION:   Sets DAC Value via public API.
|	                This is called by sequencer thread when timer is up (only on rising edge). 
|	
|       NOTES:      note: the setup portion of this module is somewhat abstracted, taking into account potential of multiple channels and configuration structs.
|
|
|	///////////////////////////////////////		
| -	// Pot Thread
|	///////////////////////////////////////		
|
|	    FUNCTION:   (1), Does an ADC conversion at regular intervals set by k_timer.
|                       -- k_timer on expiry sends a conversion event for state machine to handle.
|                   TODO: (2), filters ADC conversion values.
|                   (3) Then, sets the next MUX address for next reading.
|                   (4), Checks to see if the current pot value has changed since the last reading, if so, broadcasts pot ID and new value to listeners.
|	
|       NOTES:      note: Listener & callback is defined in main.c. On a pot change, we put a message in the sequencer queue with a Sequencer_Evt.
|                   note: edited pot id.h with descriptive names for all pots.

| -	// LED Driver Thread
|	///////////////////////////////////////
|
|       FUNCTION:   (1) Handles LED driver via SPI.
|                       When sequencer is ready to write, the sequencer thread broadcasts to its listener that is listening for a write ready signal.  
|                       When the sequencer listener hears this signal, it calls a fn in main (on_led_write_ready) that posts a SM event to the LED_Driver thread. 
|                       Event sends along (16 bit?)
|
|       NOTES:      note: need some check to see if we clear everything and write, or just add to what's existing.
|                         The idea is to have dimly lit LEDs for all active channels on both sequencer channels
|                         Brightness will be high on current step.
|                         As we'll be handling two sequences, we don't want to overwrite everything each time.
|

| -	// UART Thread
|	///////////////////////////////////////
|       FUNCTION:   Sequencer sends an event to UART thread.
|                   Send functions will be called from State Machine state. 
|                   TODO: handle RX events to send back to Sequencer [?]
|                   
|       NOTES:      ?   : currently, all midi calculations are done in UART thread. Does it make more sense to handle all those calcs in Sequencer thread?
|                   note: Listener and callback are defined in main which tranlsates the public event into a thread specific SM event, then queues that.
|                   X   : uart tx on nucleo isn't working at the moment. Getting device error. I *think* it might have something to do with the way the nucleo board
|                         has configured the mcu, but not entirely sure what's going on. device ready and device config pass just fine as far as I can tell. Just not
|                           RX enable or TX.

|
|   TODO:
|
| -	///////////////////////////////////////
|	// GPIO Thread
|	///////////////////////////////////////
|   Handles all GPIO inits. 
|   Handles external GPIO interrupts (Play/Pause & Reset)
|   Does this need it's own thread or would sequencer handle this? 
|
|
|	///////////////////////////////////////
| -	// Button Thread
|	///////////////////////////////////////
|   Handles all button events. 
|   We have 16 led-buttons to handle here. 
|   Will need a debounce. 
|   Set up a listener to look for button presses (these are less time critical than play/pause interrupts)
|       -- similar to pot thread: if a button press occurs:
|           -- Send message to sequencer thread to change sequencer active step value accordingly.
|   TODO: need to genericize. Will need to be similar to Pot thread as we'll be mux'ing here as well. 
|
|
|
|   GENERAL NOTES:
|       - With test values (which would more or less be expected of normal use), both gates and dac voltages are looking steady.
|       - Barebones, timers firing concurrently at inital 1000 ticks gates were running at, give or take, 4.6 kHz with fairly good jitter. 
|           don't think it's an issue for my purposes here. 
|       - Switched to jlink debugger, have that up and running on the nucleo board. 
|
|
|   GENERAL QUESTIONS:
|       - Generally curious about best practices for storing data within objects (e.g. seq data in Sequencer)
|       - What does genericizing the Pot module look like, especially with a MUX in the mix?
|       - How do I cleanly copy a public event to a private sm event without getting a warning about mismatched types?
